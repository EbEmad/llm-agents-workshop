However, an application can require prompting an LLM multiple times and parsing its output, so a lot of glue code must be written.\n\nLangChain makes this development process much easier by using an easy set of abstractions to do this type of operation and by providing prompt templates. In this notebook, we will cover prompt templates, why it is important, and how to use them effectively, explained with practical examples.\n\n\n#### <a id=\"top\"></a>\n# <div style=\"box-shadow: rgb(60, 121, 245) 0px 0px 0px 3px inset, rgb(255, 255, 255) 10px -10px 0px -3px, rgb(31, 193, 27) 10px -10px, rgb(255, 255, 255) 20px -20px 0px -3px, rgb(255, 217, 19) 20px -20px, rgb(255, 255, 255) 30px -30px 0px -3px, rgb(255, 156, 85) 30px -30px, rgb(255, 255, 255) 40px -40px 0px -3px, rgb(255, 85, 85) 40px -40px; padding:20px; margin-right: 40px; font-size:30px; font-family: consolas; text-align:center; display:fill; border-radius:15px; color:rgb(60, 121, 245);\"><b>Table of contents</b></div>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: rgba(60, 121, 245, 0.03); padding:30px; font-size:15px; font-family: consolas;\">\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"#1\" target=\"_self\" rel=\" noreferrer nofollow\">1.
